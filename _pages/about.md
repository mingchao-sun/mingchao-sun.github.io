Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Mingchao Sun (å­«æ˜Žè¶…). I am a researcher at the <a href="https://dept.sophia.ac.jp/is/sihs/eng/" target="_blank">Sophia Institute for Human Security</a>. I received my master's degree in economics from Sophia University and completed my Ph.D. program in March 2019.

I am an empirical researcher with a broad interest in empirical research. Social capital is the direction that interests me most, and my research tries to explain various socioeconomic phenomena from the perspective of social capital. I also try to measure social capital using a psychological approach. Then, I try to understand the different roles and mechanisms that social capital plays among different populations (e.g., immigrants, ethnic groups, women, job changers).

Some of my current research focuses on the spatial assimilation of immigrants in Japan, macroeconomic impact of remittance inflows on developing countries and emerging economies, role of social capital in labor markets, immigrants' social capital and social capital scales. My research includes China, Japan, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Timor-Leste. In addition, I have collaborated with other researchers in conflict, sanitaiton and child health. I have teaching experience in introductory economics, public economics, information economics and econometrics.

I also have a <a href="https://researchmap.jp/mingchao_sun" target="_blank">web page</a> in Japanese.
