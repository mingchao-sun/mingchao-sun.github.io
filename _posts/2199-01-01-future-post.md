### 1. ***Identifying Research Topics: Choosing a Photography Subject.***
In empirical economics, the first step is to identify a research topic, similar to how a photographer selects a specific subject from a multitude of possible scenes. This decision is based on the researcher's (or photographer's) interests, gaps in the field (market demand), and available resources (such as time, data, equipment).
2. ***Literature Review: Understanding the Shooting Environment and Techniques.***
Before embarking on empirical research, scholars conduct a literature review to grasp the existing knowledge within the field, analogous to how photographers need to understand the lighting conditions, background information, and previous photographers' techniques and compositions before shooting.
3. ***Designing Research Methods: Planning Shooting Angles and Equipment Settings.***
After deciding on the research topic, researchers need to design suitable methods, including choosing the right data, analytical tools, and models. This is akin to photographers planning their shooting angles, selecting appropriate lenses, setting exposure parameters, and deciding whether to use flash or natural light.
4. ***Collecting Data: Capturing the Scene.***
The data collection phase in empirical research can be likened to the act of taking a photograph. Researchers (photographers) need to ensure the quality of the data (scene) by using precise settings and techniques to capture "scenes" that represent the research topic accurately.
5. ***Data Analysis: Post-Processing.***
Similar to how photographers post-process their photos, economic researchers analyze data after collection. This process involves cleaning and processing the data and estimating models using statistical software, aiming to extract valuable information from the data, much like post-processing aims to enhance a photo's visual appeal and expression.
6. ***Interpreting Results and Publishing: Displaying and Telling a Story.***
The final step in the research process is interpreting results and publishing the research, closely resembling how photographers showcase their work and tell the story behind it. In this phase, researchers need to ensure their findings are understandable to peers while also conveying their research's significance and impact to the public.
